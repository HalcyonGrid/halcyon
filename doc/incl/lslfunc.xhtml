Please note that this is a work in progress, and not every constant may be listed, nor is it likely that each has a solid description.

In fact it's likely that most of what you'll find here are Halcyon-specific extensions to what LL has defined.

Please reference the <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Category:LSL_Constants">SecondLifeÂ® Wiki's Constants listing</a> for the details on constants that may not be defined here.
